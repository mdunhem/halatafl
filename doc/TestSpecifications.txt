-------------------------Description-------------------------
Game of Halatafl - (traditional Scandinavian board game)

The sheep will move first.

On their turn, any single sheep may be moved forward or
sideways into an open space. Backwards and diagonal moves
are not permitted.

On the foxes’ turn, one fox may move in any direction along
one of the lines into an open space. If a sheep is adjacent
to one of the foxes with an empty space just beyond it, the
fox can capture the sheep by jumping over it (as in checkers).
Multiple jumps are possible. Capturing is, in fact, required,
as are multiple jumps. If either fox can capture a sheep, then
one of them must do so and must execute multiple jumps if
possible.

If, on the foxes’s turn, either fox is completely surrounded
and cannot move, that fox is captured.

The sheep win the game if they can occupy all nine squares of
the “paddock”, the cluster of positions shown in orange in the
figure. The foxes win if they reduce the number of remaining
sheep below 9 (because the sheep cannot then occupy the entire
paddock.
